is it important what mode I operate in for exceptions?
initializing mmu for new core should be easier... It should be off already. Is it?
Check with kputc!  If it is off at reset, I should just have to follow a recipe to intialize it.
Look at example code in ARM book...

Double check expjmpinstr... Is 32 right? How far ahead does PC point?
Maybe its different on my board... Or maybe it has to do with prefetch stuff?
